								<h1>ALPINE SKIING.</h1>
								<div class="bold-text">Skiing is one of the world's most popular winter sports, pairing exhilarating speeds with the need for incredible precision and dexterity. Alpine skiing is a particularly intense variation of downhill skiing, in which athletes ski down extremely steep slopes, often weaving through gates and other targets in the form of an obstacle course.</div>
								<h2>The Origin</h2>
								<div class="text">
									<p>Forms of the sport which became known as skiing have an extremely long history, with some dating back to prehistoric times. Fragments and pieces of well-preserved wooden planks used as skis have been found frozen in ice or buried in places like Russia, with carbon dating determining them to be as old as 8000-7000 B.C.E. These early forms of skis were primarily used as transportation and for many years, even though skiing existed as an activity, it was not a sporting event. In its early days, skiing was used as a means of transportation to navigate inhospitable mountain regions that were difficult to travel through due to heavy snow and ice. Skiing was also primarily used by the military and was a form of transportation almost exclusive to northern European countries, such as Norway, Sweden, and Russia, who even used skiing in wars with each other.</p>
									<p>Modern downhill skiing is generally assumed to have emerged in the mid-19th Century, around 1850. Its development is attributed to Sondre Norheim, a Norwegian skier who first developed and popularized skis with curved sides that were more aerodynamic and fit for sharp turns. Norheim also utilized stiff bands for his heels, which were made of willow and, when paired with his curved skis, allowed him to develop various unique forms of turning while skiing downhill. Additionally, Norheim is credited with inventing the Telemark and Christiana turns. The Telemark turn, named for the region of Norway where it was invented, is a type of skiing where the skier lifts their heels and bends their knees to make a turn. The Christiana turn, named for the former name of Oslo, the capital city of Norway, involves forming a wedge with the skis and then bringing them parallel in the direction of the intended turn.</p>
									<p>Originally meant solely for transportation, skiing quickly developed into a sport after Sondre Norheim's developments, and soon, modern alpine skiing took shape. Though non-military skiing competitions started as early as the 1840s, the first Norwegian national skiing competition was held in 1868, and none other than Sondre Norheim was the winner of the event. Over the following decades, alpine skiing became popular across Europe and then moved to the United States, where it became a popular sport among miners during the winter months. Soon, the concept of slalom skiing (alpine skiing that involves a series of turns through markers on a curving, downhill course) was developed, and the first slalom competition was held in MÃ¼rren, Switzerland, in 1922, organized by Sir Arnold Lunn, the inventor of slalom skiing.
