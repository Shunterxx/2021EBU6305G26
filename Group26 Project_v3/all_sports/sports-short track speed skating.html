								<h1>SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATING.</h1>
								<div class="bold-text">Short track speed skating is a form of competitive ice speed
									skating. </div>
								<h2>The Origin</h2>
								<div class="text">
									<p>Short track speed skating is not nearly as old as the original speed skating that
										the Dutch invented in the thirteenth century. In 1905, Canadians and Americans
										began to practice what is now called short track speed skating. The North
										Americans did not set out with the intention to start a new sport, but a lack of
										resources created circumstances that made this outcome practically unavoidable.
									</p>
									<p>As mentioned earlier, speed skating has been around for a very long time. It was
										actually this sport that the North Americans were training for when short track
										speed skating came about. Traditional speed skating requires very large rinks
										with long straightaways and a more subtle curve. Skaters compete two at a time,
										one in the inner lane and the other in the outer lane. Lacking the space
										necessary to practice properly, people in the U.S. and Canada were forced to use
										smaller rinks. These smaller rinks had shorter straightaways and tighter curves,
										altering the skaters' strategy and approach. This became even more true when
										they began experimenting with having groups of people start at once as opposed
										to only two at a time. The group start made speed skating more physical,
										especially since skaters already had the challenges of a smaller rink to contend
										with.</p>
									<p>These differences proved to be substantial enough to anger European teams into
										not competing in speed skating events when the changes were adopted for the 1932
										Lake Placid Olympic Games in New York. Despite this, the rougher style of speed
										skating, with its mass start and collisions, continued to grow in popularity.
										This more aggressive take on the sport became known as short track speed
										skating, and, in 1967, it became recognized by the ISU. Not long after that,
										teams began to form around the world and international competitions started
										taking place annually. Short track speed skating returned to the Olympics in
										1988, but this time under its own name and as a demonstration sport. It was much
										more readily accepted this time around and was subsequently added to the
										official Olympic program by the next Winter Games in 1992.</p>
