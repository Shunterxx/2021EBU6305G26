								<h1>CURLING.</h1>
								<div class="bold-text">A popular ice sport in cold, northern climates, curling is
									sometimes referred to as the "Roarin' Game," in reference to the sound made by its
									primary playing object, the large curling stone, which is slung across a field of
									ice in an attempt to cause it to stop in the center of a target area, known as the
									house. Though the modern form of curling is a relatively recent development, similar
									ice sports have existed for many centuries and were predecessors to the modern-day
									curling that is currently featured in the Winter Olympics. </div>
								<h2>The Origin</h2>
								<div class="text">
									<p>Though curling itself was not an official sport until the 19th Century, similar
										sports have been mentioned in various historical records from much earlier times
										in human history. In the 16th Century, Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel
										(1530-1569) created a piece that depicts a sport very similar to curling being
										played on a frozen pond. Around the same time, in 1540, a record written in
										Latin by Scottish notary John McQuhin details a contest between two people at
										the monastery of Paisley Abbey, where a monk challenged a relative of the abbot
										to a stone-throwing contest performed over ice. While not identical to modern
										curling, these sports form the earliest beginnings of what would later become
										the sport of curling.</p>
									<p>Modern curling emerged as a sport in the mid-1800s, with the first curling clubs
										forming in Scotland and later spreading to areas where Scotsmen were most likely
										to settle, such as Canada, America, Sweden, Switzerland, and New Zealand, among
										others. In 1838, the first Rules of Curling were drawn up in Scotland, and the
										first official curling club, the Grand Caledonian Curling Club, was founded in
										Edinburgh, becoming the governing body of curling. In 1842, curling had gained
										enough national popularity for it to be performed in a demonstration before
										England's then-monarch, Queen Victoria. She was so intrigued by the sport that
										she granted her official permission for the Grand Caledonian Curling Club to be
										renamed the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in the following year.</p>
