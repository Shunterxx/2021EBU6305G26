                                    Vancouver 2010 and PyeongChang 2018. To do this he overcame a congenital heart

                                    tetralogy of Fallot (blue-baby syndrome), which required him to undergo two

                                        skateboarding at the age of 16. White has said that "Tony was my hero and I was
                                        too terrified to talk to him so every time I saw him at the skate park I would
                                        try
                                        to impress him with my skateboarding in the hopes that one day he would say
                                        something to me." White has won many titles on his skateboard, including the
                                        overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion, and was the first person to

                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, White again won gold in the halfpipe.
                                        In
                                        the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 on his first run, which proved a high
                                        enough score to secure the gold medal without a second run. He performed his
                                        second
                                        run anyway, as a victory lap, ending his run with a well-anticipated Double
                                        McTwist
                                        1260 which he named The Tomahawk. This second run resulted in a record score of
                                        48.4 enlarging his margin of victory.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        White finished fourth at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Halfpipe event. During
                                        the
                                        winter games, he was the most talked-about Olympic athlete on Facebook.

                                <h3>2018 Winter Olympics</h3>
                                <div class="text">
                                    <p>While in New Zealand, training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, White crashed into
                                        the edge of a superpipe; the resulting injuries to his face required 62
                                        stitches. Despite the accident, White qualified for the 2018 US Olympic
                                        Team. On February 14, he won his third Olympic gold medal for the Men's
                                        Halfpipe event with a score of 97.75. White was trailing
                                        Hirano by one full point coming into his last run with a score of 94.25. Despite
                                        this, White dramatically won the gold medal with back-to-back 1440s. His
                                        gold medal was also the 100th for the United States at the Winter Olympic Games.

                                        During the winter games, White announced it would be the last Olympics in which
                                        he
                                        would compete. Later, he announced it would be his final competition altogether.
