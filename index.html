							The Origin
						</h1>
						<p>Modern figure skating was invented by Jackson Haines. He was a ballet dancer who was born in New York in 1840. When ice skating in the 1860s, he began to skate to music instead of listening to instructors. His new version of ice skating was free flowing, charismatic, and entertaining, but audiences in the United States were not too fond of it.</p>
						<p>He packed up his bags, left his wife and two children, and headed to Europe to look for a more open-minded audience. Come to find out, his new style was appreciated in Sweden, Norway, and Russia.</p>
						<p>He was particularly popular in Vienna, Austria, where he performed in front of Franz Joseph I. He displayed his new style of skating and incorporated waltz in his program because it was popular in Vienna at the time. The sport's popularity began to grow and Haines took full advantage by opening up a skating school in Vienna, and his style was later known as Viennese.</p>
